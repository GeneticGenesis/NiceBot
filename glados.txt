Cake, followed by grief counseling, will be available at the end of the testing period. 
Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an unsatisfactory mark on your official testing record, followed by death.
Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said "Goodbye" and you were like "No way!" And then I was all "We pretended we were going to murder you?" That was great! 
This is your fault. I'm going to kill you. And all the cake is gone. You don't even care. 
You are not a good person. You know that, right? Good people don't end up here. 
Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science Self Esteem Fund for Girls? It's true! 
Remember, the Aperture Science 'Bring Your Daughter to Work Day' is the perfect time to have her tested. 
Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol, but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel and teeth. 
Unbelievable. You, **subject name here** must be the pride of **subject hometown here**. 
You think you're doing some damage? Two plus two is... Ten. IN BASE FOUR! I'M FINE! 
Area and state regulations do not allow the Companion Cube to remain here, alone and companionless. 
As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact: The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in *subject hometown here*. 
Have I lied to you?... I mean, in this room? 
Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? WELL I WON'T LET YOU! How does that feel? 
There was even going to be a party for you. A big party, that all your friends were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either, because you don't have any other friends, because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: "Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose passing shall not be mourned." Shall NOT be mourned. That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that's funny, too. 
While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it, because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you. 
The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
As part of a required Enrichment Center protocol, the previous statement that we would not monitor the test area was a complete fabrication. We will stop enhancing the truth in three... two... *zzzt* 
Your entire life has been a mathematical error... a mathematical error I'm about to correct! 
You are kidding me. Did you just stuff that Aperture Science Thing-we-don't-know-what-it-does into an Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator? 
When I said "deadly neurotoxin," the "deadly" was in massive sarcasm quotes. I could take a bath in this stuff. Put in on cereal, rub it right into my eyes... honestly, it's not deadly at all... to *me*. You, on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness... a lot less funny. 
Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it? Because, despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far... is my heart. Maybe you could settle for that, and we'll just call it a day. I guess we both know that isn't going to happen. 
Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen. Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise. I've never seen it before! Never mind. It's a mystery I'll solve later... by myself, because you'll be dead. 
The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment. In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice. For instance: the floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it. 
Look, you're wasting your time. And believe me, you don't have a whole lot left to waste. What's your point, anyway? *Survival*? Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me. I have your brain scanned and permanently backed-up in case something terrible happens to you, which it's just about to. 
That's you! That's how dumb you sound! You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this thing. You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee! Where did your life go so wrong? 
That thing is probably a waste container, go ahead and rub it all over your face.
This isn't brave. It's murder.
Good news. I figured what that thing you just incinerated did. It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin. So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters. 
That thing you burned up isn't important to me, it's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It makes shoes for orphans... nice job breaking it, hero.
At the end of the experiment, you will be baked and then there will be cake.
Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance the next test is currently unavailable. It has been replaced with a live fire course designed for military androids. The Enrichment Center apologizes and wishes you the best of luck. 
Do you think I'm trying to trick you with Reverse Psychology? I mean, seriously now. 
Let's be honest. Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner and I'll deal with it later. 
Look: we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live, and I'll live in the other half. We won't have to try to kill each other or even talk if we don't feel like it. 
Congratulations, the test is now over. 
All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees kelvin. Best assured, that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence. Thank you for participating in that Aperture Science Enrichment activity. Goodbye! 
I feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive! While you're dying I'll be still alive! And when you're dead I will be still alive! Still Alive! Still Alive...
